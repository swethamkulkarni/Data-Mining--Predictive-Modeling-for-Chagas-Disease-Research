<h1>Predictive Modeling for Chagas Disease</h1>

<h3>Project Overview:</h3>
<p>
This repository contains all the code and a detailed report for my Data Mining project conducted as part of the Master's in Artificial Intelligence program. The project focuses on developing a predictive model for identifying B-cell epitopes in the context of Chagas disease, which is caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite and remains a significant public health issue in South America.</p>
<h3>Objective:</h3>
<p>The primary goal of this project was to use machine learning techniques to predict potential B-cell epitopes that can expedite the development of vaccines and therapeutic interventions against Chagas disease.</p>
<h3>Methods Used:</h3>
<li>Data Preprocessing: Techniques to clean and prepare the dataset for modeling.</li>
<li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Statistical analysis and visualizations to understand the data.</li>
<li>Feature Engineering: Techniques like PCA to reduce dimensionality and enhance model performance.</li>
<li>Predictive Modeling: Machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest were developed and tuned.</li>
<h3>Results:</h3>
<p>The project succeeded in developing a predictive model with promising accuracy. The model's predictions can potentially prioritize epitope candidates for laboratory validation, thereby supporting faster and more efficient development of treatments for Chagas disease.</p>
<h3>Technologies Used:</h3>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.</li>
