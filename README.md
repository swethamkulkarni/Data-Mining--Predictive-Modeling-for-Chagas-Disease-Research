Predictive Modeling for Chagas Disease

Project Overview:

This repository contains all the code and a detailed report for my Data Mining project conducted as part of the Master's in Artificial Intelligence program. The project focuses on developing a predictive model for identifying B-cell epitopes in the context of Chagas disease, which is caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite and remains a significant public health issue in South America.

Objective:

The primary goal of this project was to use machine learning techniques to predict potential B-cell epitopes that can expedite the development of vaccines and therapeutic interventions against Chagas disease.

Methods Used:

Data Preprocessing: Techniques to clean and prepare the dataset for modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Statistical analysis and visualizations to understand the data.

Feature Engineering: Techniques like PCA to reduce dimensionality and enhance model performance.

Predictive Modeling: Machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest were developed and tuned.


Results:

The project succeeded in developing a predictive model with promising accuracy. The model's predictions can potentially prioritize epitope candidates for laboratory validation, thereby supporting faster and more efficient development of treatments for Chagas disease.

Technologies Used:

Python

Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
